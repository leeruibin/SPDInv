# üîé Overview framework

Pipelines of different inversion methods in text-driven editing. (a) DDIM inversion inverts a real image to a latent noise code, but the inverted noise code often results in large gap of reconstruction $D_{Rec}$ with higher CFG parameters. (b) NTI optimizes the null-text embedding to narrow the gap of reconstruction $D_{Rec}$, while NPI further optimizes the speed of NTI. (c) DirectInv records the differences between the inversion feature and the reconstruction feature, and merges them back to achieve high-quality reconstruction. (d) Our SPDInv aims to minimize the gap of noise $D_{Noi}$, instead of $D_{Rec}$, which can reduce the impact of source prompt on the editing process and thus reduce the artifacts and inconsistent details encountered by the previous methods.
